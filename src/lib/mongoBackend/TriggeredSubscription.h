* TriggeredSubscription -
*
* This class is thought to store the information about an ONCHANGE subscription
* triggered by an updateContext in order to notify, avoding a double-query on
* the csbubs collection. Note that adding all the BSON object retrieved from the
* csubs collection is not efficient, so we use only the needed fields-
*
* We use the same class for both NGSI10 and NGSI9 subscription. The only different
* is that throttling and lastNotification are not needed in the second case (note
* that there are different constructor depending the case)
