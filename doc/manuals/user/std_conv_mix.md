# Mixing standard and convenience operations

You can mix standard and convenience operations 
without any problem. Note that the set of URLs used by standard
operations
([NGSI10](#Summary_of_NGSI10_standard_operations_URLs "wikilink") and
[NGSI9](#Summary_of_NGSI9_standard_operations_URLs "wikilink")) and the
set of URLs used by convenience operations
([NGSI10](#Summary_of_NGSI10_convenience_operations_URLs "wikilink") and
[NGSI9](#Summary_of_NGSI9_convenience_operations_URLs "wikilink")) are
orthogonal.

However, take into account some convenience operations don't allow to
specify any type for entities nor for attributes, so the rules described
in [using empty types section](#Using_empty_types "wikilink") apply.
